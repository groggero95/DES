# DES
DES cracker for DigSys course, EURECOM (AY 2018/19) - Prof. Renaud Pacalet

# Objects:
For the Digital Systems course, we have designed an HW implementation in VHDL of a DES bruteforce cracker. It consists in several engines trying to find the correct key. It is compliat to the AXI Lite 4 standard, in order to communicate with the CPU present on the board. Additionally, a driver has been conceived, to interface properly with the HW implementation.

It has been tested and synthesized for a Zybo Zynq-7000 FPGA board.
More can be found in the [REPORT](./REPORT.md).
