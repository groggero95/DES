DES cracker for DigSys course, EURECOM (AY 2018/19) - Prof. Renaud Pacalet

# Objects:
For this course, we have designed a DES bruteforce cracker, which consists in several engines trying to find the correct key. It is compliat to the `AXI Lite 4` standard, and also a driver has been designed to communicate with the HW implementation.

It has been tested and and synthesized for a Zybo Zynq-7000 FPGA board.
More can be found in the [REPORT](./REPORT.md).
